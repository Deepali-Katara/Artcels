               <h2>ABOUT ASSETYZE AG:</h2>
               <p>Assetyze AG is a Swiss FinTech start-up based in Zug, innovating in the financial sector by monetising illiquid, tangible assets such as fine art through tokenisation. At present, non-bankable assets such as fine art, classic cars, watches and other precious collectibles worth billions of dollars are locked away, lying around idle. It is difficult for owners to use such assets as a collateral and borrow money against it. Assetyze unlocks the full potential of these assets and converts them to creditworthy bankable assets.</p>
